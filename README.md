# JS-Tricks.com

> JS-Tricks.com provides tips, tricks, and techniques on JavaScript running on node.js and in the browser in the form of snippets and tutorials.

JS-Tricks.com aims to become a collection of tiny JavaScript snippets that not only show what JS can do, but also describe best practices and principles every good developer should know and understand. It’s about teaching the audience using small and compressed pieces of information (i.e. code snippets) on very specific tasks. 

Every JS developer once had to dig in [reference docs and guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript) in order to learn how to code JavaScript. But these docs usually don’t include hints on how a specific feature is implemented the best way possible. Often we only head for code that just *works* without thinking about maintainability, performance, compatibility, and so on. We learn these things later on, often because we find out that code doesn’t work in a specific environment. Of course there is lots of information available on the [web](http://google.com/), especially [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript), and there are also [good](http://amzn.com/0596517742) [books](http://amzn.com/0596809484) that you should definitely read. Nonetheless we think it’s time to collect all the **small stuff**, which is learnt quickly, for everyone to look up [at a central place](http://js-tricks.com/).

That’s why [we](http://fapprik.com/) started JS-Tricks as an experiment on Tumblr. However, we quickly realized that Tumblr isn’t the best place to start a blog about coding with lots of code snippets. Thus we decided to move the blog to a file-based content management system in order to be able to manage the whole content community-driven on GitHub. Feel free to contribute!

## Getting started

JS-Tricks.com is built using [PRONTO](http://prontocms.com/). It’s pretty easy to run the site locally.
