Developers like to talk about tech stacks because it makes it easier to share information about how an application is built. Since most programming languages have known performance characteristics and limitations, the tech stack provides clues to the strengths and weaknesses of the overall application. Thus, tech stacks play a central role in the selection and hiring of developers. Usually the entire development team (in coordination with experienced tech leads) defines the tech stack of a project.
