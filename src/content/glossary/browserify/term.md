Description: A JavaScript bundler tool that allows developers to structure client-side JavaScript projects with CommonJS modules, even though CommonJS modules do not run natively in the browser.

Browserify transforms all modules and their transitive dependencies and creates a single JavaScript file that runs in the browser by traversing the dependency graph, using an entry point file, and including the source of each dependency it finds.

It requires minimal configuration, but you have to follow some conventions.
