When applications are developed and released as quickly as possible, the time available may no longer be sufficient to check the application code for errors and vulnerabilities in a sufficient manner. In the past, IT security was the task of a special team/department. That team reviewed the software in the final phase of development with regard to vulnerabilities and security issues. Due to the efficient DevOps strategy, development cycles take only a few weeks or even days, making the outdated security practices no longer sustainable in terms of time, resulting in them being left out.

The extended DevSecOps approach thinks the basic DevOps idea through to its logical end: cyber security and quality assurance no longer run separately from development. As a result, IT security doesn’t adversely affect the pace of development and teams remain agile. Teams need sufficient time to restructure from DevOps to DevSecOps, though.

By seamlessly integrating the application and cyber security, teams must be careful to efficiently and properly leverage their existing security tools during development. They can automate the integration of regular security tests (e.g. black-box checks) and thus detect software vulnerabilities at an early stage. Even after implementation, automatic monitoring can be used in real time. Among other things, these detect suspicious data queries or activities. This allows companies to react promptly in an emergency and immediately close the found vulnerabilities.
