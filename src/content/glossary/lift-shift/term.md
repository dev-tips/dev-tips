This means that enterprise applications and data are moved to a cloud-based environment with minimal changes, no customization, or redesign. No changes are made to the program code or the application itself. Generally, the cloud computing service model IaaS is used, which provides virtual computing resources such as server power, networks, and storage on a cloud platform. On this platform, the applications from the on-premises environment can continue to be operated almost unchanged in an abstracted and virtualized form.
