The basic goal of the OCI is to ensure a uniform container standard that also includes future container platforms and maintains the openness of container virtualization. Otherwise new container formats would have kept appearing that couldn’t operate with each other in the end. This way, containers shouldn’t be tied to a particular client and orchestration system or vendor.

While it’s supported by a large number of major IT companies, it’s intended to remain independent of any commercial influence.
