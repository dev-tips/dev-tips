Usually, the reason for repatriation is that many cloud migrations donâ€™t bring the direct cost benefits that were considered the core argument for outsourcing. However, looking at the pure cloud costs only is not enough. For example, new technologies such as cloud computing make it possible to digitize business processes. As a result, expenses decrease and productivity increases. The high degree of automation of processes means that fewer manual interventions and coordinations may be required.
