Alias: Static Site Generator

-----

Description: Instead of loading content on-demand from a database and rendering it dynamically each time a page is accessed, all content is rendered statically in advance and then just delivered via a simple web server.

Static web sites don’t require a database or other active components on the server as all the content has already been rendered statically in advance. While it’s sufficient for server-side web applications to simply add new content into the database, static site generators require the entire pages to be regenerated and uploaded to the server in order to make new content visible. For dynamic web applications with highly user-specific content that constantly display new content, static site generators are not suitable as no active application is running on the server and no user input can be processed.
