Isomorphic JavaScript that can run on both the client-side and the server-side. Itâ€™s the combination of (term: Server-side Rendering text: server-side rendering) and (term: Client-side Rendering text: client-side rendering), combining the advantages of both. In an isomorphic application, the initial request made by a browser is processed by the server while any subsequent request is processed in/by the client.
