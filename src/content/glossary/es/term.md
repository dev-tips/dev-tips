Text:

The standard [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) defines the ECMAScript general-purpose programming language. It describes syntax rules, basic object types, and how programs are processed while being rather abstract and excluding framework characteristic. Instead, ECMAScript defines a versatile meta-language and basic framework for many possible programming languages.
