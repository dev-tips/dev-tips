Tailwind contains basics such as colors, sizes, margins, and positioning. The respective components have still to be implemented by developers, making it different from other CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap which offer pre-implemented UI components. Using Tailwind, components can be styled within the HTML markup using Tailwindâ€™s CSS classes, making it redundant to create a separate CSS file.

There is a default configuration that can be easily overridden and customized with a `tailwind.config.js` file. Working with Tailwind is facilitated by the fact that the framework brings almost everything that is needed by itself. This consistency ensures that one can familiarize oneself with new Tailwind projects without major on-boarding problems.
