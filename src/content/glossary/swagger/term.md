[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is basically three things in one: a specification format, a collection of open source tools, and a commercial offering. Its tools not only generate API references in a semi-automatically manner, but also provide suitable client SDKs for numerous programming languages to consume this specification. It consists of a core library (»[Swagger Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core)«), an interface for visualization and test calls (»[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)«), a code generator (»[Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)«), and an editor (»[Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)«).

In 2016, the specification part of Swagger has been moved/transferred to (term: OpenAPI) in order to remain vendor-neutral and to better handle the different interests and suggestions for improvement while the open source tools, and a commercial offering continue to be offered under the name »Swagger«.
