So, here we are. Again. Exactly two years after the last post on the site, I decided to relaunch what was previously known as »JS-Tricks.com« as »Frontend-Development.com« – combined with a new design and a completely new content management system under the hood.

While the former site used to be, believe it or not, primarily about JavaScript, it’s time for it to become a site about tips, tricks, and techniques on the whole world of ever-changing frontend development. By collecting snippets, tutorials, ideas, thoughts, and stuff, the site is supposed to support you in building faster, more reliable, and more future-proof sites.

If you’d like to contribute to this site, simply head over to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rasshofer/frontend-development), fork it, make your contributions, and send a pull request.

Let’s see where this goes. Happy coding, and see you soon.
